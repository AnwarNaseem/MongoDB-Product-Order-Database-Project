# MongoDB-Product-Order-Database-Project

The ProductOrder database maintains an inventory of TV products of
various brands and models. It allows users to place orders for one or more of
these items, and offers discounts on these purchases.

In the ProductOrder database, there are mainly four categories of information:

● Product information
● Inventory information
● User information
● Order information

Objective:

With all this information in place, we need to create a Database called
ProductOrder and various collections in it. The collections needed and
The attributes that need to be in every collection are given by the Organization.
All you have to do is create collections with data in it and write some queries so
that the organization can retrieve the required information.

Files Provided:

The resources that have been shared with you as part of the zipped JSON docs
folder, there are 4 main files.

Product_info.json, 
Inventory_info.json, 
User_info.json and 
Order_info.json

The JSON files that contain the information to be inserted into the database.
